# CU Campus Building Collection
## Description
The University of Colorado was founded in 1876 as the State University in Boulder, Colorado. Since then, the University has expanded to multiple locations within the state. In 1974, a state constitutional amendment passed that created the University’s four campus system, with campuses in Boulder, Denver, and Colorado Springs. The CU Campus Building Collection contains information, photographs and moving images pertaining to those buildings on four campuses. Materials dating from as early as 1877 within multiple archival collections have been made available.
